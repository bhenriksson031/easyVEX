The License allows you to do pretty much anything you want with this code. You don't have to mention me when you use this stuff, but I appreciate it if you do. Please send me a message (email or something) if you mention me somewhere, so I can find out about it.

Please contribute to this project! Tell me what I am doing wrong. Tell me how I can improve performance. Add new functions. 
I want to learn from you!
